# ICE 04: Websockets
https://ice04-chrislam.onrender.com/

Worked alone for this; This ICE is just a simple chatbot! It takes in your username and then people can start messaging back and forth! The only challenges were just understanding how Svelte works, which only took a few. Additionally, I figured out that you do have to change the URL LOL and also switch the ws -> wss for it to work, due to security reasons.
